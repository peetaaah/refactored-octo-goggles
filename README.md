# refactored-octo-goggles
terrascope test. had to throw off other people, haha

## Notes:
I'm aware that there's a bunch of stuff that is somewhat messy, but I'll refactor as best as I can as the days go on.


## Packages:
1. Multer.
2. Express.
3. UUID.
4. Nodemon (Dev dependency, just for easy testing / hot reloads)
